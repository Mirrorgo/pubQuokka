# Introduction
The Clinical Simulated Data Platform can be demonstrated by the following diagram.

# Explanation
## Application
It is the Front-end component of this platform. The front-end is implemented by React and hard to be divided into different component. This application include Nextjs, React and Echarts. And it plays an important role in demonstrating the whole project.

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot is a framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of Spring applications. It offers various auto-configuration options and conventions that make building and deploying applications easier. In the project, Spring Boot is responsible for establishing the foundational structure of the entire application, managing dependencies, configurations, and providing out-of-the-box features such as web servers, security, logging, and more.

## MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. In this project, MySQL is used for storing and managing the persistent data required by the application, such as user information, article content, transaction records, and more. By using MySQL, it becomes efficient to organize and retrieve large volumes of data while ensuring data persistence and consistency.

## MyBatis
MyBatis is a persistence framework that offers object-relational mapping (ORM) capabilities, simplifying the mapping between Java objects and database records. In this project, MyBatis handles the mapping between database operations and Java objects, facilitating data storage and retrieval. It assists us in writing database operation statements using XML or annotations, providing convenient methods for database operations, thus reducing the manual effort required to write SQL statements.

## Sandbox
Sandbox is an outside program to operate some simulated data
